# vermuino

An arduboy port of the Game & Watch game titled "Vermin". I took the source code and bitmap assets from here: http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Game-Watch/ and ported it.

## Bugs and known issues

There are no lives, no gameovers, and no UI. Missing a mole plays a painfully slow animation.

## Installing

To install, check out the guide and on the arduboy forums: https://community.arduboy.com/t/quick-start-guide/2790
